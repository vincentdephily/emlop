# This is an example emlop config file.
#
# To use it, copy to $HOME/.config/emlop.toml (or to whatever you set $EMLOP_CONFIG to) and
# uncomment the desired lines.
#
# All config items have a corresponding command-line arg, see `emlop <subcommand> --help` for
# detailed format and behavior. Not all command-line args have a config item, this file lists all
# the supported items.
